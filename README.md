# LaptopmanFace
A watch face for Pebble watches starring my signature "Laptopman" avatar. Shake to alternate between your laptop pal and his evil twin!

**Note:** This app was written in C, a language that I am not super familiar with. As a result, the code might not be as elegant as it could be, but I'm working on it!
